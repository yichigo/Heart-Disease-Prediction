Heart Disease Prediction


###  Program Language:
	python
	
### Packages: 
	pandas,
	numpy,
	matplotlib,
	sklearn,
	plot_learning_curve ( download from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_learning_curve.html)

### input and output
the input data has been saved in ./data/
the output plots will be saved to ./plot/


### Running

To run the codes, open Jupyter Notebook and go to the folder ./src/

#### There are 5 different models:
	Decision Tree (DT),
	Neural Networks (NN),
	AdaBoost(AB),
	Support Vector Machines(SVM),
	k-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)

For example, if you want to run the Decision Tree (DT) model, open DT.ipynb and run it.

Similarly for the other models.
